# PeriodicTable
The periodic table of (HTML) elements

This is my first project that includes HTML, CSS and JS. I based the idea on the chemical periodic table and put a fun coding twist onto it.
The project currently features CSS grid, JS modals and some nice glow effects. 

I plan to improve this by being able to click out of the modal to close it, rather than having to click the x.
